# AutoSensitivity
AutoSensitivity allows you to define different mouse sensitivities (speeds) for your touchpad and mouse and automatically switch between them (based on mouse connect / disconnect).

This utility is for everyone who wishes to uses different mouse speeds (sensitivities) with touchpad and mouse. If you do not want to change the speed everytime you plug in a mouse, this utility is for you. You simply define two different speeds and the utility automaticaly switches between them accodring to you pluging and unpluging your mouse.
